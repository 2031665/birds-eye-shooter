i have found few tutorials on how to set up the workspace for the Unity program and i am learning what does what with unity atm. i am downloading few free artpacks to test.
i have started creating the background of the game with an art package. the art package i have used is this https://thomasgvd.itch.io/top-down-shooter. i have learned how to add animations so added the idle animation to the main character, i have also added a few components to the main character such as Rigidbody 2D and Box Collider 2D. this RigidBody2D components applies the rules of the physics engine to the main character. (example of this could be the applied gravity on the character.) and BoxCallider2D component detects the collisions of the objects in game(example of this is bullet hitting the enemies and so on).

i have mostly created animations and set up the art work for the game i will start coding the scripts tomorrow. and i also have to find a way to connect the python code that does the eye-movement-tracker with the C# on unity apperantly there are many ways but the one that i found most interesting is a plugin called Python for Unity.
